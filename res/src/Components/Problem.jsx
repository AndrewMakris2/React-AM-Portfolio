        <h3>My Approach to Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>
          I follow a structured approach to cybersecurity challenges that involves quickly identifying issues,
          thoroughly analyzing root causes, and implementing effective mitigations. I emphasize clear documentation
          and communication throughout the process to ensure transparency and continuous learning.

      <section>
        <h3>Risk Management Frameworks & Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          I apply industry-standard frameworks such as the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) to evaluate the
          likelihood and impact of cybersecurity threats. This helps prioritize remediation efforts and focus on
          high-impact risks. I also leverage quantitative and qualitative risk assessments to guide decision-making.

        <h3>Tools and Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools like Splunk for log analysis</li>
          <li>Network traffic analysis with Wireshark to identify anomalous behavior</li>
          <li>Vulnerability scanning tools to detect and prioritize weaknesses</li>
          <li>Root cause analysis and timeline reconstruction during incident investigations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Case Study: Phishing Incident Response</h3>
        <p>
          During a simulated phishing campaign detection, I utilized Splunk to identify suspicious email patterns,
          correlated them with user-reported incidents, and isolated affected accounts promptly. I then assisted in
          remediation by coordinating password resets and user awareness training. Post-incident, I helped update
          email filtering rules and detection queries to prevent recurrence.

        <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          Every incident is a learning opportunity. I document findings, update playbooks, and communicate lessons
          learned across the team to strengthen our overall security posture.

        <h3>Soft Skills in Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>
          Effective risk management requires collaboration and clear communication. I prioritize working with
          cross-functional teams and stakeholders to ensure aligned goals and timely resolutions.
